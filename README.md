# Wave Pocket Detection

This project uses a fine-tuned YOLOv8-nano model to identify the “pocket” zone of a wave in real-time surf footage. The goal is to help surfers and coaches visualize optimal positioning on the wave.

## Demo Clips
Below are four inference videos produced by the model. Each demonstrates pocket detection on different surf footage:
